## What it does

- Press `-` to open the current directory as a text document
- Press `-` again to go to parent directory  
- Press `Enter` to open files or folders
- No new tabs, everything happens in the same buffer

## How to use

1. Open any file in VS Code
2. Press `-` to see the directory as text
3. Use arrow keys to navigate, `Enter` to open things
4. Press `-` to go up a directory

That's it!

## File indicators

- `[DIR]` - folders
- `[FILE]` - regular files  
- `[JS]` - JavaScript files
- `[TS]` - TypeScript files
- And a few others...

## Why?

Sometimes you just want to navigate files like text. If you've used oil.nvim, you'll feel right at home.
